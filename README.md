A Minecraft style game test project with DirectX

This is my personal test project.  You would find little benefit
in searching this project's sources.  If you'd like to hack with Minecraft
based game engine, see Minetest:

This is also pretty old project.  The DirectX SDK is now XNA Game Studio,
so you may find it a bit difficult to build it at all.
